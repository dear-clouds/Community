# Community Repo

Community Repository for Unofficial Cloudbox Add-ons.
All those taks have been tested multiple times but the Community repo take months to check pull requests so you can just clone my task folder here.

**Make sure your repo is up-to-date first and only clone the specific taks listed below.**

## My Fork

Adding new projects, just switch branch. So far:

- [Mango](https://github.com/hkalexling/Mango)
- [Shoko](https://shokoanime.com/)
- [unpackerr](https://github.com/davidnewhall/unpackerr) (soon)
